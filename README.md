## About Me

I'm a sunny and warm-hearted person, with my family serving as driving sources of inspiration. I have devoted several years to studying and applying cloud technologies and am eagerly looking forward to specializing in the industry. Some of my favorite hobbies include training my dogs, playing NFL Fantasy Football, Chess Evolved Online, and reading manga.

## My AWS Repository

For security reasons, I currently maintain my compiled work in a private repository. If you are a potential employer interested in reviewing my cloud-based experiences, please don't hesitate to contact me for a zip archive. My repository contains walkthroughs and insights gathered from the lab and project hours I've devoted to AWS. I am planning to review and make it publicly accessible once I complete my Tech U course.
